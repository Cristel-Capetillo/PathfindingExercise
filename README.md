# PathfindingExercise
 Explores pathfinding using the AStar algorithm in Unity.
 - Units / Agents (several) can travel from their point A to the target point B by requesting a pathfinding
 - They move to target point B and user can see on screen each of the paths Units / Agents took
 - Units / Agents can avoid obstacles and the algorithm always calculate the shortest distance to destination
